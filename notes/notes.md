Difference between Function vs Class components 

  Because a functional component is just a plain JavaScript function, you CANNOT use setState() in your component. That’s the reason why they also get called functional stateless components. So everytime you see a functional component you can be sure that this particular component doesn’t have its own state.

  If you need a state in your component you will either need to create a class component or you lift the state up to the parent component and pass it down the functional component via props.

  Conclusion:

  Cons:
  - no setState()
  - no LifeCycleMethods

  Pros:
  - easier to read and test because they are POJOs
  - less code
  - easier to separate container and presentational components
    because you will be forced to think more about component's
    state because you do not have access to setState() (you do so
    in Class components)
  - possible future performance boost (React team announcement)

  Mini conclusion: 
  
  And so to answer our question before, you should use functional components if you are writing a presentational component which doesn’t have its own state or needs to access a lifecycle hook. 

  NOTE: You can still "filter" state when you are using Class component. this.state = this.props.slice (slice is passed down from container component)

  - Difference Between NAME and VALUE of INPUT HTML ELEMENT

  Only form elements with a name attribute will have their values passed when submitting a form.

  The ID of a form input element has nothing to do with the data contained within the element. IDs are for hooking the element with JavaScript and CSS. The name attribute, however, is used in the HTTP request sent by your browser to the server as a variable name associated with the data contained in the value attribute.

  BUGGGZ BUNNY: 


  So, when I save DOB custom made, it is saving "/ /" in 
  case no DOB submitted. WHICH PASSES THE VALIDATION!!!!
  

Giving Exactly the same Route path 
but Link changes the URL to the one withou /#/
so Refreshing the page causes "GET: blah blah NO SUCH ROUTE" error
  - the whole problem was the part that renders ABOUT
  - has path set up EXACT hence and following paths 
  - are not being rendered

RECEIVE_POST is updating the FE but in order for Assoc to work and 
return proper Array of ids inside User, we need to render user too...
  --> We update User's array of post Ids based on RECEIVE POST action inside User's Reducer.

Login/Signup/Demo/Edit Profile WILL NOT render proper
components, only refresh does so. 

Each post contains ALL the comments made by the same user. That is just a straight up logical flow. 
I need to make sure each comment is under the post that it belongs to.
- Filter based on postId === myCommnet.postId

#TODO: How to make sure each comment made also updates number of comments shown on the post?
